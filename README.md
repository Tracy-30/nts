# NewsTextSum

This is a PyTorch implementation of abstractive text summarization from both *Pretrain-Based Natural Language Generation for Text Summarization* (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09243>) and *BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension* (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461>)

We focused our dataset on CNN/Daily Mail (<https://github.com/JafferWilson/Process-Data-of-CNN-DailyMail>)

## Novelty

After reproduction, we anticipate to apply BART into the two-stage textsum model to see how much improvements we would get.
